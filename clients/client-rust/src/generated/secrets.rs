///

/// data.  Access is limited by scopes, so values can be considered secret from
/// those who do not have the relevant scopes.
///
/// Secrets also have an expiration date, and once a secret has expired it can no
/// longer be read.  This is useful for short-term secrets such as a temporary
/// service credential or a one-time signing key.
