The index service now uses its tables directly, rather than via taskcluster-lib-entities.  This is step 2, a continuation of https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/pull/3141. Step 2 involved creating new DB functions and refactoring the service itself to use the new functions. The db upgrade should be very fast.
